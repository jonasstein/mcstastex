\component{Arm}{System}{(none)}{(none)}{}
\index{Optics!Point in space (Arm, Optical bench)}

The component {\bf Arm} is empty; is resembles an optical bench
and has no effect on the neutron ray.
The purpose of this component is only to provide a standard
means of defining a local co-ordinate system within the instrument definition.
Other components may then be
positioned relative to the {\bf Arm} component
using the \MCS\ meta-language.
The use of {\rm Arm} components in the instrument definitions
is not required but is recommended for clarity.
{\bf Arm} has no input parameters.
