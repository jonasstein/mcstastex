\chapter{About the component library}
\label{s:components}
The component library is
maintained by the \MCS\ system group. A number of basic components 
``belongs'' the \MCS\ system, while other are contributed
by specific authors, mentioned  along with each component.

Users are encouraged to send
contributions to us for inclusion in future releases.

In the description of the theory behind the component functionality 
we will use the usual symbols {\bf r} for the position 
$(x,y,z)$ of the particle (unit m), and {\bf v} for 
the particle velocity $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ (unit m/s).
Another frequently used symbol is 
the wave vector ${\bf k} = m_{\rm N} {\bf v}/\hbar$ , where
$m_{\rm N}$ is the neutron mass. {\bf k} is usually given in
\AA$^{-1}$, while neutron energies are given in meV.
In general, vectors are denoted by boldface symbols.
Subscripts "i" and "f" denotes ``initial'' and ``final'', respectively,
and are used in connection with the neutron state before and after
an interaction with a component.
Note that all mentioning of component geometry refer to
the local coordinate system of the individual component.

The source code for a few selected components is listed 
in Appendix~\ref{compcode}. 
Source code for all component may be found in the \verb+lib/mcstas/+
subdirectory of the McStas installation; 
the default is \verb+/usr/local/lib/mcstas/+.

An overview of the component library is also given at the \MCS\ home page...
