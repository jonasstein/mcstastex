\chapter{The component library}
\label{s:components}

This chapter has been removed from the manual and will instead be published 
in a separate manual describing the McStas components. The McStas component manual will be edited by the McStas authors and it will include contributions from users writing components. Until the \MCS\ component manual is published we refer to the McStas web-page~\cite{mcstas_webpage} where all components are documented using the McDoc system or to previous manual for 
release 1.4.
