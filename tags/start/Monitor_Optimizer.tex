\subsection{Monitor\_Optimizer: Optimization locations for the
  Sour\-ce\_Op\-ti\-miz\-er component}
\label{s:monitoroptimizer}

This component was contributed by Emmanuel Farhi, Institute
Laue-Langevin.

The {\bf Monitor\_Optimizer} component works with the {\bf
  Source\_Optimizer} component. See section~\ref{s:sourceoptimizer}
for usage.

The input parameters for {\bf Monitor\_Optimizer} are the rectangular
shaped opening coordinates $x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}, y_{\rm min}$,
$y_{\rm max}$ (in meters), and the name of the associated instance of
the {\bf
  Source\_Optimizer} component used in the instrument description file (one word,
without quotes).
