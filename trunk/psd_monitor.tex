\section{PSD\_monitor: The PSD monitor}
\component{PSD\_monitor}{System}{$x_{\rm min}$, $x_{\rm max}$, $y_{\rm min}$, $y_{\rm max}$, $n_x$, $n_y$, filename}{}


The component {\bf PSD\_monitor} resembles other monitors, e.g. 
{\bf E\_Monitor}, and also propagates the neutron to the detector
surface in the $(x,y)$-plane, where the detector window is set
by the $x$ and $y$ input coordinates.
The PSD monitor, though, is not sensitive to the neutron energy, but
rather its position. the rectangular monitor window is divided
into $n_x \times n_y$ pixels, each of which acts like a single
counter.

The output from {\bf PSD\_monitor} is the integrated counts, $n, I, M_2$, 
as well as 
three two-dimensional arrays of counts: $n(x,y), I(x,y), M_2(x,y)$.
The arrays are written to a file and can be read e.g. by the tool
{\bf MC\_plot}, see the system manual.

og s\aa\ blev den en 2D cylinder detektor??}
