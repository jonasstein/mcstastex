\section{Beamstop: A neutron absorbing area}
\label{beamstop}

\component{Beamstop}{System}{$x_{\rm min}$, $x_{\rm max}$, $y_{\rm min}$, $y_{\rm max}$, $r$}{}

The component {\bf Beamstop} can be seen as the reverse of 
the {\bf Slit} component.
It sets up an area at the $z=0$ plane, and propagates the neutrons 
onto this plane (by the kernel call PROP\_Z0).
Neutrons within this area are ABSORB'ed, 
while all other neutrons are unaffected.

By using this beamtop, some neutrons contributing to the background
in a real experiment will be neglected. 
These are the ones that scatter off the side
of the beamstop, or penetrates the absorbing material.
Further, the holder of the beamstop is not simulated.

{\bf Beamstop} can be either circular or rectangular.
The input parameters of {\bf Beamstop} are the four coordinates,
$(x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}, y_{\rm min}, y_{\rm max})$
defining the opening of a rectangle, or the radius $r$ of 
a circle, depending on which parameters are specified.
