\chapter{About the component library}
\label{c:components}
The component library is
maintained by the \MCS\ system group. A number of basic components 
``belongs'' the \MCS\ system, and are supported and tested by the \MCS\
team.

Other components are contributed
by specific authors, who are listed at each component
they contribute.
\MCS\ users are encouraged to send their
contributions to us for inclusion in future releases.

In the description of the theory behind the component functionality 
we will use the usual symbols {\bf r} for the position 
$(x,y,z)$ of the particle (unit m), and {\bf v} for 
the particle velocity $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ (unit m/s).
Another frequently used symbol is 
the wave vector ${\bf k} = m_{\rm N} {\bf v}/\hbar$ , where
$m_{\rm N}$ is the neutron mass. {\bf k} is usually given in
\AA$^{-1}$, while neutron energies are given in meV.
In general, vectors are denoted by boldface symbols.
Subscripts "i" and "f" denotes ``initial'' and ``final'', respectively,
and are used in connection with the neutron state before and after
an interaction with the component in question.
Note that all mentioning of component geometry refer to
the local coordinate system of the individual component.
The axis convention is so that the $z$ axis is along 
the neutron propagation axis, the $y$ axis is vertical up, 
and the $x$ completes the right-handed coordinate system.

Source code for all components may be found in the \verb+lib/mcstas/+
subdirectory of the McStas installation; 
the default is \verb+/usr/local/lib/mcstas/+ 
on Unix-like systems and \verb+C:\mcstas\lib+ on Windows systems, but it can be
changed using the \verb+MCSTAS+ environment variable. 
\index{Environment variable!MCSTAS}

As a complement to this Component Manual, we encourage users to use
the \verb+mcdoc+ front-end which enables to display both the 
catalog of the \MCS\ library, e.g using: \index{Tools!mcdoc}
\begin{quote}
  \verb|mcdoc --show|
\end{quote}
as well as the documentation of specific components, e.g with:
\begin{quote}
  \verb|mcdoc --text| {\it name} \\
  \verb|mcdoc --show| {\it file.comp}
\end{quote}
The first line will search for all components matching the {\it name}, 
and display their help section as text, 
whereas the second example will display the help corresponding to 
the {\it file.comp} component, using your 
BROWSER\index{Environment variable!BROWSER} setting, or as text if unset. 
The \verb+--help+ option will display the command help, as usual.

An overview of the component library is also given at the \MCS\ home page...
