\chapter{About the component library}
\label{c:components}
This \MCS\ Component Manual consists of the following major parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item An introduction to the use of Monte Carlo methods in \MCS .
\item A thorough description of system components,
with one chapter per major category: Sources, optics (two chapters),
monochromators, samples, monitors, and other components.
\item The \MCS\ library functions and definitions
  that aid in the writing of simulations and components in
  Appendix~\ref{c:kernelcalls}.
\item A detailed explanation of the use of random numbers 
   in Appendix~\ref{s:random}.
\item An explanation of the \MCS\ terminology in Appendix~\ref{s:terminology}.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, you may refer to the list of example instruments
from the library in the \MCS\ User Manual.

\section{Authorship}
The component library is
maintained by the \MCS\ system group. A number of basic components
``belongs'' the \MCS\ system, and are supported and tested by the \MCS\
team.

Other components are contributed
by specific authors, who are listed in the code for each component
they contribute as well as in this manual.
\MCS\ users are encouraged to send their
contributions to us for inclusion in future releases.

Some contributed components have later been taken over 
for further development by the \MCS\ system
group, with permission from the original authors.
The original authors will still appear both in the component code and in the
\MCS\ manual.

\section{Symbols for neutron scattering and simulation}
In the description of the theory behind the component functionality
we will use the usual symbols {\bf r} for the position
$(x,y,z)$ of the particle (unit m), and {\bf v} for
the particle velocity $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ (unit m/s).
Another essential quantity is the neutron wave vector
${\bf k} = m_{\rm n} {\bf v}/\hbar$ , where
$m_{\rm n}$ is the neutron mass. {\bf k} is usually given in
\AA$^{-1}$, while neutron energies are given in meV.
The neutron wavelength is the reciprocal wave vector,
$\lambda=2 \pi / k$.
In general, vectors are denoted by boldface symbols.

Subscripts "i" and "f" denotes ``initial'' and ``final'', respectively,
and are used in connection with the neutron state before and after
an interaction with the component in question.
%This is of particular importance in sample components, where the
%wave vector change is denoted the {\em scattering vector}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:q-transfert}
%{\bf q} \equiv {\bf k}_{\rm i} - {\bf k}_{\rm f} .
%\end{equation}
%In analogy, the {\em energy transfer} is given by
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:w-transfert}
%\hbar \omega \equiv E_{\rm i}-E_{\rm f} =
%\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_{\rm n}} \left( k_{\rm i}^2 - k_{\rm f}^2 \right).
%\end{equation}

The spin of the neutron is given a special treatment. Despite
the fact that each physical neutron has a well defined spin value, 
the \MCS\ spin vector
{\bf s} can have any length between zero (unpolarized beam) and unity
(totally polarized beam). Further, all three cartesian components of
the spin vector are present simultaneously, although this is physically
not permitted by quantum mechanics.
Presently, no official \MCS\ component utilize the neutron spin. 

\section{Component coordinate system}
All mentioning of component geometry refer to
the local coordinate system of the individual component.
The axis convention is so that the $z$ axis is along
the neutron propagation axis, the $y$ axis is vertical up,
and the $x$ axis points left when looking along the $z$-axis,
completing a right-handed coordinate system.
Most components 'position' (as specified in the instrument description
with the \verb+AT+ keyword) corresponds to their input side at the nominal
beam position.
However, a few components are radial and thus positioned in their centre.
\index{Symbols}\index{Coordinates system}

Components are usually not designed to overlap.
This may lead to loss of neutron rays.
Warnings will be issued during simulation if sections of the instrument
are not reached by any neutron rays, or if neutrons are removed.
This is usually the sign of either overlapping components
or a very low intensity.\index{Removed neutron events}

\section{Component source code}
Source code for all components may be found in the \verb+MCSTAS+ library
subdirectory of the McStas installation;
the default is \verb+/usr/local/lib/mcstas/+
on Unix-like systems and \verb+C:\mcstas\lib+ on Windows systems, but it may be
changed using the \verb+MCSTAS+ environment variable.
\index{Environment variable!MCSTAS}

For temporary modification of a component, it is advised to make a copy
of the component file into the working directory.
A component file in the local directory will in \MCS\ take precedence over
a library component of the same name. In case users only require to add new features, preserving the existing features of a component, it is recommanded to make use of the \verb+EXTEND+ keyword\index{Keyword!EXTEND}, as documented in the User Manual.

\section{Documentation}
As a complement to this Component Manual, we encourage users to use
the \verb+mcdoc+ front-end which enables to display both the
catalog of the \MCS\ library, e.g using: \index{Tools!mcdoc}
\begin{quote}
  \verb|mcdoc|
\end{quote}
as well as the documentation of specific components, e.g with:
\begin{quote}
  \verb|mcdoc --text| {\it name} \\
  \verb|mcdoc| {\it file.comp}
\end{quote}
The first line will search for all components matching the {\it name},
and display their help section as text,
whereas the second example will display the help corresponding to
the {\it file.comp} component, using your
BROWSER\index{Environment variable!BROWSER} setting, or as text if unset.
The \verb+--help+ option will display the command help, as usual.

An overview of the component library is also given at the \MCS\ home page \cite{mcstas_webpage} and in the User Manual \cite{mcstasmanual}.

\subsection{About data files}\index{Data files}\index{Library!read\_table-lib (Read\_Table)}
Some components require external data files,
e.g. lattice crystallographic definitions for Laue and powder pattern diffraction,
$S(q,\omega)$ tables for inelastic scattering,
neutron events files for virtual sources,
transmission and reflectivity files, etc.

Such files distributed with \MCS\ are located in the
\verb+data+ sub-directory of the \verb+MCSTAS+ library.
Components that make use of the \MCS\ file system,
including the \verb+read-table+ library (see section \ref{s:read-table})
may access all \MCS\ data files without making local copies.
Of course, you are welcome to define your own data files,
and eventually contribute to \MCS\ if you find them useful.

File extensions are not compulsory but help in identifying relevant files per application.

\section{Component validation}

\section{Disclaimer, bugs}\index{Bugs}

We would like to emphasize that the usage of both the \MCS\ software, as well as its components are the responsability of the users. Indeed, obtaining accurate and reliable results requires a substantial work when writing instrument descriptions. This also means that users should read carefully both the documentation from the manuals \cite{mcstasmanual} and from the component itself (using \verb+mcdoc+ {\it comp}) before reporting errors. Most anomalous results often originate from a wrong usage of some part of the package.

Anyway, if you find that either the documentation is not clear, or the behavior of the simulation is undoubtedly anomalous, you should report this to us at \verb+mcstas@risoe.dk+ and refer to our special bug/request reporting service \cite{mczilla_webpage}.
