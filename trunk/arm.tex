\section{Arm: The generic component}
\label{explain:arm}
\component{Arm}{System}{(none)}{(none)}{}
\index{Optics!Point in space (Arm, Optical bench)}

The component {\bf Arm} is empty; is resembles an optical bench
and has no effect on the neutron ray.
The function of this component is only to set up a local
co-ordinate system within the instrument definition.
Other components may then be
positioned relative to the {\bf Arm} component
using the \MCS\ meta-language.
The use of {\rm Arm} components in the instrument definitions
is not required but is recommended for clarity.
{\bf Arm} has no input parameters.

In stead of the first {\rm Arm} component in an instrument,
the user should consider to use {\bf Progress\_bar} 
(see section \ref{s:progress-bar}) which like {\bf Arm} has no effect
on the neutron ray. 
However, {\bf Progress\_bar} displays the simulation progess, 
and may even save the data files in the course of the simulation, 
so that results can be studied \emph{during} the simulation.
