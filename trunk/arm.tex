\section{Arm: The generic component}
\label{explain:arm}
\component{Arm}{System}{(none)}{(none)}

The component {\bf Arm} is empty; is resembles an optical bench
and has no effect on the neutron.
The function of this component is only to set up a local 
co-ordinate system within the instrument definition. 
Other components may then be
positioned relative to the arm component
using the \MCS\ meta-language.
The use of arm components in the instrument definitions
is not required but is recommended for clarity.

{\bf Arm} has no input parameters.
An example of the use of this component is given in the 
sample instrument definitions, listed in Appendix \ref{instcode}.
