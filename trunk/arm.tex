\section{Arm: The generic component}
\label{explain:arm}
\component{Arm}{System}{(none)}{(none)}{}
\index{Optics!Point in space (Arm, Optical bench)}

The component {\bf Arm} is empty; is resembles an optical bench
and has no effect on the neutron.
The function of this component is only to set up a local
co-ordinate system within the instrument definition.
Other components may then be
positioned relative to the arm component
using the \MCS\ meta-language.
The use of arm components in the instrument definitions
is not required but is recommended for clarity.

{\bf Arm} has no input parameters.

An alternative to the Arm component is the {\bf Progress\_bar} (see section \ref{s:progress-bar}) which does the same as Arm, {\it i.e.} nothing, but also displays the simulation progess, and optionally saves regularly the data files in the course of the simulation, so that you can look at it raising \emph{during} the simulation.
