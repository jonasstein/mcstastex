\chapter{Samples}
\index{Library!Components!samples}

This class of components models the sample of the experiment.
This is by far the most challenging part of a neutron scattering
instrument to model. However, for purpose of simulating
instrument performance, details of the samples are rather unimportant,
allowing for simple approximations. On the contrary, for full
virtual experiments it is of importance to have realistic and
detailed sample descriptions. \MCS\ contains both simple and detailed
samples, although there is still room for much more development.

We first consider incoherent scattering. The simple component {\bf Vanadium}
performs both incoherent scattering and absorption.

An important component class is elastic Bragg scattering from an ideal powder.
The components {\bf Powder1} and {\bf Powder2} model a simple powder with one or two
reflections and incoherent scattering. Finally, the {\bf PowderN} component extends the capabilities to N lines, read from a LAZY/Crystallographica data file.

Next type is Bragg scattering from single crystals.
The simplest single crystals are in fact the monochromator components
{\bf Monochromator\_flat} and {\bf Monochromator\_curved},
which were presented in the section on optics.
The monochromators are models of a thin mosaic crystal
with a single scattering vector perpendicular to the surface.
Much more advanced, the component {\bf Single\_crystal}
is a general single crystal sample (with multiple scattering) that allows
the input of an arbitrary unit cell and a list of structure factors, and
also allows anisotropic mosaic and $\Delta d/d$ lattice space variation.

Isotropoic small-angle scattering is simulated in {\bf Sans\_Spheres},
which models scattering from a collection of hard spheres. A more general
SANS sample is highly wanted. In addition, a reflectometry sample
should be developed.

Inelastic scattering from a dispersion is exemplified by
the relatively simple component {\bf Phonon}.

For a more general sample model, the {\bf Isotropic\_Sqw} component is able to simulate all kinds of isotropic materials: liquids, glasses, polymers, powders, ... Physical processes include coherent/incoherent scattering, both elastic and inelastic, with absorption and multiple scattering. Moreover, this compoennt may be used concentrically, to model a sample environment. Thus it may handle most samples except single crystals.

In general, all samples are assumed to be homogeneous. There would also be
potential in developing an inhomogeneous sample, e.g. with
spatially varying lattice constant, relevant for stress/strain scanners.
Inhomogeneously absorbing sample for tomography could also be possible.
Further, no polarization effects are yet taken into account in any
of the samples.
