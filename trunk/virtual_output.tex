\section{Vitual\_output: Saving the first part of a split simulation}
\label{virtual_output}

\component{Virtual\_output}{System}{filename}{buffer size, type}

The component {\bf Virtual\_output} stores the neutron ray parameters
from a split simulation. It is then possible to let the 
next part of the simulation be performed by another instrument,
which reads the stored neutron ray
parameters by the component {\bf Virtual\_input}.

All neutron ray parameters are saved to the output file, which is by default
of ``text'' type, but can also assume the binary formats 
``float'' or ``double''. The storing of neutron rays continue until the 
specified number of simulations have been performed.

For performance reasons, it is possible to specify the size of 
the buffer to use in writing the neutron rays to file. Default 
is to buffer the whole file, but this may be fatal for very large
simulations.
