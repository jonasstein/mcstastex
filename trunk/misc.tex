\chapter{Special-purpose components}

The chapter deals with components that are not easily included 
in any of the other chapters because of their special nature,
but which still are considered to be of significant importance 
to \MCS .

One part of these components deals with splitting simulations
into two (or more) stages. For example, a guide system is often
not changed much, and a long simulation of neutron rays
``surviving'' through the guide system could be reused 
for several simulations of the instrument back-end, speeding up
the simulations by (typically) one or two orders of magnitude.
The components for doing this trick is {\bf Virtual\_input} and
{\bf Virtual\_output}, which stores and reads neutron rays, respectively.

Another pair of components performs the simulation of the instrument
resolution functions. This is {\bf Res\_sample}, that is to be
placed at the sample position, and {\bf Res\_monitor}, that should
be localized at the position of the instrument detector.
