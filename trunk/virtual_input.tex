\section{Vitual\_input: Starting the second part of a split simulation}
\label{virtual_input}

\component{Virtual\_input}{System}{filename}{buffer size, repeat count, type}

The component {\bf Virtual\_input} resumes a split simulation where the 
first part has been performed by another instrument and the neutron ray
parameters have been stored by the component {\bf Virtual\_output}.

All neutron ray parameters are read from the input file, which is by default
of ``text'' type, but can also assume the binary formats 
``float'' or ``double''. The reading of neutron rays continue until the 
specified number of rays have been simulated or 
till the file has been exhausted. If desirable, the input file
can be reused a number of times, determined by the optional parameter
``repeat count''. However, care should be taken when dealing with 
absolute intensities, which are automatically correct only
when the input file has been exhausted once.

For performance reasons, it is possible to specify the size of 
the buffer to use in reading the neutron rays from file. Default 
is to buffer the whole file, but this may be fatal for very large
input files.
