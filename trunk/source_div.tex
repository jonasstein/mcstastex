{\bf Source\_div} is a rectangular source which emits a
beam of a certain divergence around the main exit direction
(the direction of the $z$ axis).
The beam intensity and divergence are uniform over
the whole of the source, and the energy distribution
of the beam is uniform.

This component may be used as a simple model of the
beam profile at the end of a guide or at the sample
position.

The input parameters for Source\_div are the source dimensions
$w$ and $h$ (in m), the divergencies $\delta_h$ and $\delta_v$ (FWHM in degrees),
and the mean energy $E_0$ and the energy spread $dE$ (both in meV).
The neutron energy range is $(E_0-dE; E_0+dE)$.
If the \verb+gauss+ flag is set to 0, the distribution is uniform, instead of Gaussian.
