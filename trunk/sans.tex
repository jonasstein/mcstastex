\section{Sans\_spheres: A sample of hard spheres for small-angle scattering}
\label{sans}

\component{Sans\_spheres}{System, Lise Arleth}{$R$, $x_w$, $y_h$, $z_t$, $r$, $\sigma_a$}{$phi$, $q_{max}$, $\Delta \rho$}{}

The component {\bf Sans\_spheres} models a sample of small independent
spheres of radius $R$, which are uniformly distributed
in a rectangular volume $x_w \times y_h \times z_t$ with a volume
fraction $\phi$. The absorption cross section density for the spheres
is $\sigma_a$ (in units of m$^{-1}$), specified
for neutrons at 2200 m/s. Absorption and incoherent scattering from the medium
is neglected.
The difference in scattering length density
(the contrast) between the hard spheres and the medium is called $\Delta \rho$.
