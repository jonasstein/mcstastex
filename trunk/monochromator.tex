\chapter{Monochromators}

In this class of components, we are concerned with elastic Bragg
scattering from monochromators. {\bf Monochromator\_flat} 
models a flat thin mosaic crystal with a single scattering vector
perpendicular to the surface.  
The component {\bf Monochromator\_curved} is physically similar, 
but models a singly or doubly bend monochromator crystal arrangement.

A much more general model of scattering from a single crystal is 
found in the component {\bf Single\_crystal},
which is presented under Samples, chapter~\ref{c:samples}.
