\chapter{Monochromators}

In this class of components, we are concerned with elastic Bragg
scattering from monochromators. {\bf Monochromator\_flat}
models a flat thin mosaic crystal with a single scattering vector
perpendicular to the surface.
The component {\bf Monochromator\_curved} is physically similar,
but models a singly or doubly bend monochromator crystal arrangement.

A much more general model of scattering from a single crystal is
found in the component {\bf Single\_crystal},
which is presented under Samples, chapter~\ref{c:samples}.

\section{Single\_crystal: Thick single crystal monochromator plate with multiple scattering}
\index{Optics!Monochromator, thick}

The {\bf Single\_crystal} component may be used to study more complex monochromators, including incoherent scattering, thickness and multiple scattering. Please refer to section \ref{s:Single_crystal}.
