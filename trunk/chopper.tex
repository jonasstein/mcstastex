To cut a continuous neutron beam into short pulses, or to control
the pulse shape from a pulsed source, one can use a disc
chopper (see figure~\ref{f:chopper1}). This is a fast rotating disc with the
rotating axis parallel to the neutron beam. The disk consists of neutron
absorbing materials. To form the pulses the disk has openings through which
the neutrons can pass.

Component {\bf Chopper} has $n$ openings, which are
symmetrically positioned on the disc. You can set the direction of
rotation, which allows to simulate double choppers. You can also define
the phase by setting the time at which one slit is positioned at the
top. The sides of the slits are pointing towards the center of the disc.
The thickness of the disc is neglected.  There is no parameter for the
size of the slits in the radial direction;
use e.g. a {\bf Slit} component in front of the chopper.

Using a rectangular shaped beam with nearly the same
size as the slit, yields an almost triangular shaped
transmission curve (see figure~\ref{f:chopper2}).

When simulating the chopping of a continuous beam,
most of the neutrons could easily be lost.
To improve efficiency, one can set the flag \verb+IsFirst+, which will
allow every neutron ray to pass the {\bf Chopper}, but modify the
time, $t$, to a time at which it is possible to pass.
This can also be used with TOF-instruments, which often
define the starting time of the neutrons at
the position of the first chopper.
Of course, there should be only one ``first chopper'' in
any simulation.
To simulate frame overlap from a ``first chopper'', one can specify
the number of frames to study by the parameter $n_{\rm pulse}$.
