\chapter{Planned expansions of \MCS\ in the future}
\label{future}

During the work so far on
\MCS, we have run across a number of points we would like to
include in \MCS\ in the future.

For the \MCS\ meta-language itself, these points include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Facilities for making a Monte-Carlo choice on the basis of 
tabulated values. This would be useful in source and filter components.
\item Facilities for assembling a number of existing components into one
compound component, like a multi-bladed analyser.
\end{itemize}
We also would like to improve on the component and instrument libraries:
\begin{itemize}
\item Output in NeXus format.
\item Allow multiple scattering in sample components.
\item More samples for inelastic scattering.
\item A powder sample with more than one reflection.
\item Handle gravitation.
\item The RITA spectrometer.
\item The new Ris\o\ TAS7 spectrometer.
\item A detailed version of the ISIS PRISMA spectrometer.
\end{itemize}
Further, we would like to make improvements on the interface software:
\begin{itemize}
\item Interface to existing control software ({\em e.g.} the Ris\o{}
  program TASCOM)
\end{itemize}
