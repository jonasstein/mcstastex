\section{Bragg scattering single crystals, monochromators}

In this class of components, we are concerned with elastic Bragg
scattering from single crystals. The Mosaic\_anisotropic component
models a thin mosaic crystal with a single scattering vector
perpendicular to the surface. It is a replacement for the Monochromator
component from previous releases; it uses a better algorithm that works
in some cases where the old component would give wrong results. The
Mosaic\_simple component is similar, but has an isotropic mosaic and
allows a scattering vector that is not perpendicular to the surface. The
Single\_crystal component is a general single crystal sample that allows
the input of an arbitrary unit cell and a list of structure factors, and
also allows anisotropic mosaic and $\Delta d/d$ lattice space variation.

\subsection{Monochromator: The monochromator crystal}
The component {\bf Monochromator} is obsolete as from McStas version
1.2. Use the component {\bf Mosaic\_anisotropic} instead.
